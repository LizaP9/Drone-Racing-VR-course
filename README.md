# Drone Racing: VR Course

This repository contains my project from the **Drone Racing VR Course**, where I developed a basic drone simulation and racing track using **Unity**. The project involves creating a drone controller, a racing track with gates, and a user interface to display racing stats in real-time.

## 📝 Project Overview

### Objective
The main task of the project was to create a drone racing simulation with the following features:
1. **Drone Controller**: Write a simple controller that maps keyboard inputs (W, S, A, D, etc.) to the physical forces applied to the drone's rigid body.
2. **Propeller Rotation**: During flight, the propellers of the drone must rotate realistically.
3. **Drone Racing Track**: Import gates into the scene and set up a track for drone racing.
4. **Camera Follow**: Implement a camera system that follows the drone smoothly throughout the race.

### Racing Stats Display
During the race, the user interface displays important stats such as:
1. **Gate Passing**: An event triggers when the drone passes through a gate.
2. **Gate Count**: Track and display the number of gates the drone has successfully passed.
3. **Real-Time Data**: Show control input, time elapsed, and drone position, which update every frame.

## 🎮 Features
- **Simple Drone Controller**: Allows smooth and responsive drone movement using keyboard inputs.
- **Propeller Animations**: Realistic propeller rotation during flight.
- **Racing Track**: A set of gates to create a challenging drone racing track.
- **Dynamic Camera**: The camera dynamically follows the drone, offering a great user experience.
- **Racing Stats Interface**: Displays important flight stats such as gate passes, control inputs, and position in real-time.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Unity Engine**: Used for building the 3D environment, drone, and racing track.
- **C#**: Implemented drone controller and game logic.
- **Physics System**: Utilized Unity's Rigidbody system for realistic drone movement.
  
## 🎮 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LizaP9/Drone-Racing-VR-course.git
   ```

2. Open the project in **Unity**.

3. Play the game and control the drone using the following keyboard inputs:

- **W**: Move forward
- **S**: Move backward
- **A**: Strafe left
- **D**: Strafe right
- **Space**: Move up
- **Left Ctrl**: Move down

4. 📈 Racing Stats
The following stats are displayed during the race:
- **Number of Passed Gates**: Keep track of how many gates you’ve passed.
- **Real-Time Info**: Shows your control input, elapsed time, and drone position in real-time.
